# Data Modelling Framework - UiPlugin - TabsView

The `tabs` plugin allows you to browse deeply nested, complex objects in a practical manner by opening complex children in a new tab.

Add the package to your project with `npm add @development-framework/tabs`.

If you want to specify a config object in some UiRecipe-entity, the Blueprint is included in the npm package.

Copy it like so: `cp -R node_modules/@development-framework/tabs/dist/blueprint ./myApplicationBlueprints/`
