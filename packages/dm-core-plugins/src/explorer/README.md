# Explorer

The explorer plugin makes it possible to view documents from DMSS. The plugin consists of a TreeView where the user can
explore documents in different packages. It is also possible to open multiple documents at the same time. If several
documents are opened, each document will have its own tab.

This plugin also adds a right click context menu to the TreeView. In this context menu, the user can perform different
actions:

* Create a new entity inside a given folder
* Create a new blueprint inside a given folder
* Create new folders
* Delete documents

No blueprints are added for this plugin.
